# Configuring and Securing Redpanda
In Chapter 1 of the [Hands-on Redpanda: Cluster Operations course][course-link], we show you how to:


- Configure cluster and node properties
- Put nodes in maintenance and perform rolling restarts
- Create ACLs to manage access to the cluster and its resources

The full tutorial is contained in the [course][course-link]. It includes a multi-node Docker deployment, which you can start by running the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
